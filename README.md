# Simple-Multiplayer-Unity3D
This is a project created as part of a web game development class at the university. It is a simple game that allows you to create a host and have a client connect to it. The player moves a character that has the ability to shoot other players. If the player's life points drop to zero he will be killed and will revive after a few seconds.
